# Newrelic::Thor
> NewRelic instrumentation to Thor tasks

Introspect performance of Thor tasks with NewRelic performance monitoring.

Inspired by the [newrelic-rake gem](https://github.com/flyerhzm/newrelic-rake)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'newrelic-thor'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Instrumentation is automatically loaded once you require the gem!
Can't get much easier then that!
